Description
-----------

This project is a full configuration of a React component library with more than 20 UI components. It can be used as a template for other React projects, providing a solid foundation for building complex web applications with a comprehensive set of tools and technologies. Its well-designed architecture and extensive testing environment make it a great starting point for any development team looking to build scalable, maintainable, and high-quality applications. The project includes the following tools and technologies:

-   Webpack
-   TypeScript
-   Babel
-   SCSS
-   CSS modules
-   Vite
-   Prettier
-   Jest
-   React Testing Library
-   Storybook
-   Loki
-   Cypress
-   ESLint
-   Stylelint
-   React-router-dom v6
-   Redux Toolkit
-   RTK Query
-   EntityAdapter

The project has a well-structured configuration, with a large number of plugins and loaders. It also includes a comprehensive testing environment with unit, component, and E2E tests.

The project has a strong focus on architecture, module decomposition, and business entities with loose coupling and strong cohesion. The project also includes several advanced features such as async components, async Redux reducers, reducer managers, and endpoint injections for better code splitting.

Installation
------------

To install the project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

    bashCopy code

    `git clone <repository-url>`

2.  Install the dependencies:

    Copy code

    `npm install`

Configuration
-------------

The project has a comprehensive configuration, including ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier for code quality, and Webpack and Babel for module bundling and transpiling.

Component Library
-----------------

The project includes a library of more than 20 UI components, including modal windows with portals, dropdown menus, sidebars, buttons with different themes, skeletons, popups, lazy images, drawers, avatars, vertical and horizontal stacks, and more.

The library has a well-designed architecture with module decomposition and business entities with loose coupling and strong cohesion.

Testing
-------

The project has a comprehensive testing environment, including unit, component, and E2E tests. The project uses Jest for unit tests and React Testing Library for component tests. E2E tests are run using Cypress.

Storybook
---------

The project includes Storybook, and each component has a story case describing all its states. The project also includes screenshot tests, allowing for regression testing of the interface.

ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier
-------------------------------

The project includes ESLint and Stylelint for code quality, with a custom plugin containing three rules for architecture, module isolation, and correct access to layers. Prettier is also included for code formatting.

React-router-dom v6
-------------------

The project uses React-router-dom v6 for routing.

TypeScript and Babel
--------------------

The project uses TypeScript and Babel for transpiling and type checking. The project uses union types and generic components extensively.

EntityAdapter
-------------

The project uses EntityAdapter for data management.

Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
---------------------------

The project uses Redux Toolkit for state management, and RTK Query is used for data fetching. The project also includes advanced features such as async components, async Redux reducers, reducer managers, and endpoint injections for better code splitting.

CI Pipeline
-----------

The project includes a CI pipeline that runs unit, component, and E2E tests, builds the project, Storybook, and lints the code. The project also includes pre-commit hooks using Husky. The project generates reports for unit and screenshot tests with information about successful and failed tests, and these reports are published on GitHub Pages.

Infrastructure
--------------

The project has a well-designed infrastructure, allowing the project, testing environment, and Storybook to use all the features and work as a single unit. The infrastructure includes TypeScript, CSS modules, and global build variables.
